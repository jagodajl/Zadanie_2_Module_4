Hi Rafal,

I don't think I understand loggs deeply. I kind of imported the 'logging' library and used logging.info, but then I put print there :(.
Therefore, my solution is a little bit of: "PIC NA WODÄ˜". I feel like it could be done better.

Do you have any nice link that I could read to fix my code?
